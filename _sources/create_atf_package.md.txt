# Create ATF package

## Structure

## Launch file

There is one central launch, called `application.launch` file which will be started by ATF.
It should contain all the rosnodes that are required to perform the test run.
Besides, it must provide certain arguments which enable to start the test with the desired variations.

TODO name the required nodes

The next step is to create the actual test application node, which ATF will automatically include into the launch file.
